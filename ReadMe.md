# Connect X - Pygame

This is my attempt to create a visual "Connect X" (Think Connect 4, TicTacToe, etc) using the Pygame library. The logic
and structure of my game is going to be based on an earlier project I made that was entirely done in the terminal. 
 
### TODO

Polish/complete the pre-game / rules display screen, particularly the "no" option

Create a system that will be able to keep track of the grid for the purposes of handling the game, allowing the 
CPU to make moves, checking for victories, etc.

Save features, stat-tracking features, replay features, etc.
