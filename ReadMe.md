# Connect X - Pygame

This is my attempt to create a visual "Connect X" (Think Connect 4, TicTacToe, etc) using the Pygame library. 

The logic and structure of my game is going to be based on an earlier project I made that was text-based and existed
entirely in the command terminal environment. 

This game also demonstrates some new concepts for me, such as (simple) animations present in some screens.
 
### TODO

Integrate Cell class with cell blitting/generating functions

Basic enemy turn function (random)

Win/Loss/Tie checks

Polish/complete the pre-game / rules display screen, particularly the "no" option

post-game resets

Save features, stat-tracking features, replay features, etc.
